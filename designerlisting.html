      <p class="epsilon highlight text-center"><strong></a>About the Position</strong></p>
      <p>The traditional approach to making websites is being disrupted by new technologies. Static site generators, build automation tools and git are leading the way.</p>
      <p>Netlify has rolled all the services needed to take your code, build it and host it on our CDN into a single automated platform. Creating modern, high performance websites and applications is simpler, cheaper and more secure than ever.</p>
      <p>Started just a year ago, we’re already serving hundreds of millions page-views per month. We have a long list of clients like Instrument, WeWork and Uber, and we’ve helped thousands of developers build web applications.</p>
      <p>We’re looking for a full-time designer to make Netlify better for developers, designers and anyone who creates for the web. You will be responsible for driving the product design strategy, branding and user experience. We’re still a small team, so being comfortable writing code for front-end applications is a huge plus.</p>
      <p>We’re based in San Francisco, and we are looking for someone local, but we’ll consider remote employment for the right candidate.</p>
