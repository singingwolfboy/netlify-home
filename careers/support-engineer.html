      <p class="epsilon text-center"><strong></a>About the Position</strong></p>
      <p class="content content--wide text">We feel that our customer support should be a defining feature of our products, and this role is critical. You’ll be joining us as a founding member of the company, being an advocate on behalf of customers, making our product and our company better. Our goal is providing world-class support to our users.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">To do this we need help answering their questions, helping to solve their problems, and keeping things moving fast for them. We’re looking for a full-time support engineer – a position within the engineering team, as the role is deeply technical as well as being a major voice working with customers who need our help. Our customers are developers – just like us – so we want someone who will listen to them, help them, and be their voice within the company.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">Netlify is growing quickly, so we want someone who will work smarter, not harder (through scripts, tooling, documentation and other efficiencies) to keep up with the many awesome users we have, and who are joining us every day.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">You’ll be responsible for answering support requests (currently via email, chat and a small amount of phone), building internal tooling to speed up processes, and unearthing insights and patterns from the support realm.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">You should love problem-solving, using words to help solve said problems, and the empathy to help people.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">Because Netlify is a mix of React, Go and some touches of C++, you should be comfortable with diving into code to problem-solve, agnostic to tools and languages in these areas.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">We’re based in San Francisco, and we are looking for someone local, but we’ll consider remote employment for the right candidate.</p>
      <p class="epsilon text-center"><strong>About You</strong></p>
        <p class="content content--wide text">We’re looking for someone who:</p>

        </ul>
      <p class="epsilon text-center"><strong>About the Company</strong></p>
      <p class="content content--wide text">The traditional approach to making websites is being disrupted by new technologies. Static site generators, build automation tools and git are leading the way.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">Netlify has rolled all the services needed to take your code, build it and host it on our CDN into a single automated platform. Creating modern, high performance websites and applications is simpler, cheaper and more secure than ever.</p><br>
      <p class="content content--wide text">Started just a year ago, we’re already serving hundreds of millions page-views per month. We have a long list of clients like Instrument, WeWork and Uber, and we’ve helped thousands of developers build web applications.</p>
