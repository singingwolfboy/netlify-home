      <p class="epsilon highlight text-center"><strong></a>About the Position</strong></p>
      <p>The traditional approach to making websites is being disrupted by new technologies. Static site generators, build automation tools and git are leading the way.</p>
      <p>Netlify has rolled all the services needed to take your code, build it and host it on our CDN into a single automated platform. Creating modern, high performance websites and applications is simpler, cheaper and more secure than ever.</p>
      <p>Started just a year ago, we’re already serving hundreds of millions page-views per month. We have a long list of clients like Instrument, WeWork and Uber, and we’ve helped thousands of developers build web applications.</p>
      <p>We’re looking for a front-end developer to work closely with our entire team to push Netlify’s benefits to developers, designers and anyone who wants to create for the web.</p>
      <p>You should love building tools for other developers, and enjoy the balance between polishing every little piece of UI on the one hand, and shipping at startup speed on the other.</p>
      <p>Our core tools are React and Redux with a dash of Webpack and a whiff of Babel, but it’s more important that you have a solid foundation as a developer and a good sense of architecture and clean code. Frameworks and tools come and go, but the fundamentals stay the same.</p>
      <p>We’re still a small team, so being comfortable writing code for back-end applications is a huge plus.</p>
      <p>We’re based in San Francisco, and are looking for someone local, but we’ll consider remote employment for the right candidate.</p>
      <p class="epsilon highlight text-center"><strong>Our Ideal Candidate</strong></p>
