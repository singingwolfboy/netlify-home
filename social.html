          On LinkedIN we also have a group about all web tech thats static. It’s not commercial at all, we really just want to exchange ideas and experiences on how to take static to the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Static-WebTech-6949357">“Static web-tech”</a> and we would love for you to join. Whether you are just learning to code or invented Ruby on rails - let’s make the net faster, safer, simpler and cheaper :-)
