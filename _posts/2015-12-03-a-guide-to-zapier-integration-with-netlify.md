As you may have seen in yesterday's newsletter netlify now has [Zapier app](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/27442/6c1b6a3bbcf86c07c0a0f7dfe2d0327c/) in beta.

It lets you integrate form submissions or deploy notifications from netlify to hundreds of external services like MailChimp, Hipchat, Google Docs, etc,.

What that means is that in a few easy steps you can set up the app to send you a notification whenever a new form is submitted, or a deploy is finished and pushed live. The notification could be a mail, a message in slack or hipchat, or almost anywhere else.

<!-- excerpt -->

Matt Highland is a long time BitBalloon and netlify customer and runs several popular [codeschools](https://www.hackingtons.com/) in the Bay Area.

He made a great video tutorial that he let us share with you. It shows you how you set up a form with netlifyâ€™s built-in form processing tool and then use the netlify Zapier app to export the data from every submission to a google doc spread sheet.

Enjoy.
