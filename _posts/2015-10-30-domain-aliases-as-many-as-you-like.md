With our new domain alias feature, you can easily point several domains or subdomain to the same site.

Sometimes you have more than one domain that needs to resolve to the same website. Most other static hosts can only handle 1 domain per website, but with netlify‘s new domain alias feature, you can easily point several domains or subdomains to the same site.

Our flexible rewrite rules also means you can even handle different subdomains as folders within the same site.
