Smarter Redirects

We just made netlify&rsquo;s redirect engine smarter, to avoid chained redirects.


Before if you had a site on [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) with a redirect from /blog to /news, with https enabled, then going to [http://example.com/blog](http://example.com/blog) would trigger a chain of redirects:


[http://example.com/blog](http://example.com/blog) -&gt; [https://example.com/blog](https://example.com/blog) -&gt; [https://www.example.com/blog](https://www.example.com/blog) -&gt; [https://www.example.com/news](https://www.example.com/news)

  
Now our redirect engine is smart enough to detect that chain and redirect straight from [http://example.com/blog](http://example.com/blog) to [https://www.example.com/news](https://www.example.com/news)

All this happens straight on our CDN nodes, so the extra roundtrip time when people get redirected is as low as possible.
