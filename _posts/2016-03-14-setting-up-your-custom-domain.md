So you've splashed out on a personal domain, and want to connect it to your site hosted on netlify. Great! Here, we'll walk you through how to connect your site to your custom domain from most of the popular domain name registrars.

First, you want to  tell netlify to use your custom domain. You can do this through the web UI by clicking "Edit domain" when viewing your site.

<!-- excerpt -->

**We highly recommend using a www domain instead of an apex domain (ie. www.example.com instead of example.com**. Unless your DNS provider supports ANAME or ALIAS records for the apex domain you wonâ€™t be able to take full advantage of our CDN unless you use the **www** prefix or a similar subdomain. If you want an apex domain to point to your site, follow our documentation [here](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains#naked-domains).

Next, the standard values: If your registrar isn't listed [below](#walkthroughstart), then you can use these standard values to set up your domain.

**CNAME**: `www` should point at `example.netlify.com` (replace `example` with the name of your site as listed at [https://app.netlify.com/sites](https://app.netlify.com/sites))

**A Record**: your raw domain (`example.com`) should be pointing to `198.61.251.14`

![Example DNS Records](/img/docs/dns-records.png)

Once you've added these new values, visiting `www.example.com` will take you to your new site. Remember, it could take a few hours to start pointing traffic in the right direction.
