And best of all? You always only pay for what you use. No need to overprovision for hosting."

  - title: Atomic Deploys
    body: "We view your site as a whole, not a bunch of pages. When pushing a change to your site live ***without*** Atomic Deploy you’re pushing files live one-by-one, which could lead to missing assets, broken links or dropped connections as your new version loads. Avoid periodically broken sites with Netlify, where all deploys are atomic."
  - title: Unlimited Snapshots
