    body: "Netlify is completely designed around a RESTful API. Manage, query and deploy a site all using simple HTTP calls."
    footer: "[See API documentation](/docs/api.html)"
  - title: Native Clients
    body: "Donâ€™t feel like writing the HTTP calls? We have native clients in [Javascript](https://github.com/netlify/node-client), [Go](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-go) and [Ruby](https://github.com/netlify/ruby-client)."
  - title: JavaScript Injection

  - title: "Redirect, Rewrite & Proxy Rules"
    body: "Use different rules to control how requests are handled. Proxy part of your traffic to your own backend, redirect old pages, or rewrite a page entirely. Or do them all."
  - title: Custom HTTP Headers
