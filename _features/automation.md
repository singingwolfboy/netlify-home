title: Automation
icon_id: feature-prerendering
description: "Let netlify automate your workflow. The separation of frontend and backend opens up a whole new world of possibilities. But it also means a lot of manual work, manually integrating and managing different tools and processes. Until now."
features:
  - title: Git Integration
    body: "Netlify pairs naturally with Git. If you use GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or just your own private repo, we let you pull, change and push to manage your site."
  - title: Automated Builds
    body: "Leave the build boxes to us. Continuous deployment is as simple as telling us how and what to build. Then rapidly deploy your site with standard git commands."
  - title: Inbound Webhooks
    body: "Trigger builds with a POST request to integrate with external APIs, schedule builds of your site or trigger rebuilds from a Google Spreadsheet."
    footer: "[What can you do with webhooks?](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks)"
  - title: "Outbound Webhooks & Integrations"
    body: "Set up any number of outbound webhooks. Receive email or Slack notifications for new form submissions, deploys or build failures."
    footer: "[What can you do with webhooks?](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks)"
  - title: Secure Build Environment
    body: "We never store any GitHub tokens on our servers, and your builds are run in a completely locked down environment."
    footer: "[Read more about GitHub tokens &amp; netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/github-permissions)"
  - title: Cached Dependencies
    body: "Dependencies (rubygems, npm, etc.) are automatically installed and cached between builds to keep build time down."
    footer: "[Read more about dependencies and run times](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment)"
  - title: Instant Cache Invalidation
    body: "One of the problems with releasing a new site is that you never know if a user is viewing a cached version. Netlify invalidates the cache instantly, serving only the intended version across the globe. Never wait to see a live version again."
  - title: Versioning & Rollbacks
    body: "Each lightweight deploy is treated as an immutable snapshot of the site. Rolling back as far as youâ€™d like is just a matter of clicking the version you want live."
