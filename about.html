      Our mission is simple. We want to take modern static websites and apps mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
      Because the current web is a mess. Seriously though. Every week we go to Hackernews and follow a broken link. 79% of all Wordpress sites are vulnerable to known exploits, which alone represents 20% of all website.
      </p>
      <p>
      The emergence of mobile means a lot of slow loading sites with towering bounce rates and loss of business to follow. We should do better. We must actually. Because we can. Static websites have always been faster, safer, simpler and cheaper. It’s just that browsers and shared hosting services weren’t good enough, so there were too many compromises.
      </p>
      <p>
      Making the slow, vulnerable and expensive legacy sites the best alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
      But no more. The browser is all grown-up, and CDNs have really seen the light of day.
      </p>
      <p>
      Netlify is a unified platform that automises all the work you need to do around your code to create high performant, easily maintainable site or web-app. Simply push to netlify and watch your site fly.
