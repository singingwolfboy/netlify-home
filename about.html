      Our mission is simple. We want to take static websites and apps mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
      Because the current web is a mess. Seriously though. Every week we go to Hackernews and follow a broken link. Just two weeks ago 7 million Drupal sites were infected with malware. 79% of all Wordpress sites are vulnerable to known exploits.
      </p>
      <p>
      The emergence of mobile means a lot of slow loading sites with towering bounce rates and loss of business to follow.
      We should do better. We must actually. Because we can.
      Static websites have always been faster, safer, simpler and cheaper. It’s just that browsers and shared hosting services weren’t good enough, so there were too many compromises
      </p>
      <p>
      Making the slow, vulnerable and expensive traditional “dynamic” sites the best alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
      But no more. The browser is all grown-up, and CDNs have really seen the light of day.
